Team TOMO took a mobile first approach when building TOMO; we highly recommend using TOMO on your mobile device, though your device of choice can be used as well.


## The Goal

TOMO offers users a fun and engaging way to enter goals completed throughout the day, influenced by the extremely popular Tamagotchi game. These goals are separated into different categories of an individual's health, Mental, Physical, and Emotional. We challenge users to log goals daily, increasing the meters above our avatar Tomo to represent a job well done. By doing so, we hope users develop healthy habits from daily action.

When logging daily tasks, users will receive feedback depicted by floating icons above Tomo. For example, a Emotional Bar with a low value will render a heart above Tomo's head, suggesting the user to accomplish some emotional related tasks throughout the day.

Health Meters will reset by end of day, allowing users to tackle new goals, with the hopes of building positive habits!
